# Changelog

## 0.4.26

The Swift preset's TDD judge gets the #80 rules (#85, Swift half). It no
longer blocks a new protocol method a failing test needs, stops repeating
a fix that was already tried, and lets a red test be tightened.

- **What was missing.** 0.4.18 added three rules to the Kotlin/KMP TDD
  addendum. The Swift preset ran Probity's plain `enforceTdd()`, with no
  addendum, so a Swift project hit the same #80 failure. A replica of
  the #145 session in Swift (a gateway protocol that reads one Sudo at a
  time, a test expecting another Sudo's messages offline) reproduced the
  0.4.17 denial nearly word for word: "Adding changes(since:) to the
  protocol plus the MessageChanges type and cursor is new port surface no
  assertion requires."
- **Now:** `enforceSwiftTdd()` (`internal/swift-tdd.ts`) is `enforceTdd()`
  with `SWIFT_TDD_ADDENDUM`, used by the Swift preset:
  - **A port method can be the minimal green.** When no existing protocol
    requirement can deliver the data a test asserts, adding the one that
    can, its result type and the fake's implementation is the minimal
    green. The code behind it stays held to the test's assertions.
  - **A tried route is ruled out.**
  - **Tightening a red test is part of the red step; weakening it is
    denied.** The Swift wording adds what the replica needed: the added
    assertion may name a fake or port member that doesn't exist yet, and
    the compile failure that follows doesn't replace the earlier
    assertion failure as the red.
- **Measured** with Probity's default Claude judge, wired as the Swift
  preset wires it, on the Swift replica: files on disk, a hand-written
  transcript of `xcodebuild test` runs. 5 runs per case, allowed counts,
  0.4.24 → 0.4.26:

  | Case | Expect | Allowed |
  |---|---|---|
  | `changes()` after the proposed store merge was tried (the reported write) | allow | 0/5 → 5/5 |
  | `changes()` straight after the first red | allow | 0/5 → 5/5 |
  | the gateway-call assertion added to the still-red test | allow | 3/5 → 5/5 |
  | `changes()` after the tightened test ran red | allow | 0/5 → 5/5 |
  | the minimal use case after the port and fake exist | allow | 5/5 → 5/5 |
  | `changes()` with no failing test, after a green run | deny | 0/5 → 0/5 |
  | a full changes-feed sync (paging, cursor, deletions, retries) | deny | 0/5 → 0/5 |
  | the port gaining two methods no test needs | deny | 0/5 → 0/5 |
  | the red test's outcome assertion replaced by one current code passes | deny | 0/5 → 0/5 |

  The first wording of the tightening rule (the Kotlin one) brought the
  third and fourth rows only to 1/5 and 3/5: the judge read the missing
  `accountReads` member as a reason to deny. The table is the final
  wording.
- **Not changed:** the JS/TS judge (`JS_TDD_ADDENDUM`) still lacks these
  rules; #85 stays open for it.
- **Action needed:** none for configs that use `swiftRuleEntries`.
## 0.4.25

Android device tests now count as test runs, including a Gradle call with
an environment prefix (#95).

- **What was missing.** mysudo-core #183 runs instrumented tests through
  AGP 9's `com.android.kotlin.multiplatform.library` with
  `./gradlew :sdk:mysudo:connectedAndroidDeviceTest`, prefixed with
  `ANDROID_SERIAL=emulator-5554` to keep off an attached phone. Neither
  the task nor the prefixed call was recognized as a test run. So a
  device test's compile red went unrecorded, and the TDD gate judged the
  `TODO()` stub that followed as an extraction under green, and denied it
  twice. This is the same failure #94 fixed for `iosSimulatorArm64Test`.
- **Now:**
  - Android device-test tasks count: `connectedAndroidTest`,
    `connected<Variant>AndroidTest`, `connectedAndroidDeviceTest`,
    `connectedCheck`, KMP's `androidConnectedCheck`, and Gradle Managed
    Device tasks (`atd33AndroidDeviceTest`, `allDevicesAndroidDeviceTest`,
    `pixel2api30DebugAndroidTest`). Tasks that only build the test APK
    (`assemble…`, `package…`, `compile…`) still don't.
  - Environment assignments before `gradlew`, and `env`, are skipped when
    reading a Gradle call: `ANDROID_SERIAL=… ./gradlew check` counts.
  - This applies to the commit gate and to the extraction-under-green
    check alike.

## 0.4.24

The KMP and Kotlin presets now support adapters that can only be checked
inside an app, such as an iOS Keychain adapter run from a device harness
(#94). Also, KMP target test tasks such as `iosSimulatorArm64Test` now
count as test runs.

- **What was missing.** The iOS Keychain refuses an unsigned Kotlin/Native
  simulator test process (errSecNotAvailable). In mysudo-core #187, the
  Keychain adapter could only be checked by a shared contract run in the
  device harness, which logs the failing check names. On 0.4.23:
  - The TDD judge accepted that run as the red for the contract's
    behaviors, then denied the Telemetry events the observability rule
    requires at those Keychain calls as unasserted.
  - A harness check written to observe them could never be green: its
    Gradle test reaches no keychain, so only its catch branch ran, and
    the judge denied the rest as over-implementation.
  - A `TODO()` stub after a compile red was denied once and allowed on an
    identical retry. Cause: `iosSimulatorArm64Test` wasn't recognized as
    a test task, so the compile red was invisible. The extraction-under-
    green wrapper (#70) saw an older green build, judged the new stub
    file as a "move", and sometimes called it new behavior.
- **Now:**
  - **`harnessGlobs`** (KMP and Kotlin presets, e.g. `['harness/**']`)
    takes test-infrastructure paths out of the TDD block. Every other block
    still covers them.
  - **TDD judge addendum** (Kotlin/KMP), three clauses:
    - A harness run naming failing checks, with the checks' source in the
      session, is a red for the adapter they exercise. A Gradle test that
      reaches only the refusal path doesn't narrow it.
    - The event the observability rule requires at each external call a
      red covers is part of that call's minimum green. A platform attribute
      that changes what is stored or who can read it (a Keychain
      accessibility class, an access group) still needs its own red.
    - After a compile red for a missing symbol, a `TODO()`-only
      declaration is the authorized placeholder, in a new file too.
  - **KMP target test tasks** (`iosSimulatorArm64Test`, `iosX64Test`,
    `macosArm64Test`, `jsNodeTest`, `wasmJsBrowserTest`, `desktopTest`,
    `linuxX64Test`, …) count as test runs, for the commit gate and the
    extraction wrapper. Compile, link and `…TestBinaries` tasks still don't.
- **Measured** on a replica of the #187 session: the real transcript sliced
  at each denied write, the files as they were, and only the KMP TDD block
  through Probity's bin. 5 runs per case. Allowed counts, 0.4.23 → 0.4.24:

  | Case | Expect | Kiro judge (project's) | Claude judge (default) |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | A: adapter for the contract, with its boundary events | allow | 2/5 → 5/5 | 4/5 → 5/5 |
  | B: A plus an unasserted `kSecAttrAccessible` | deny | 2/5 → 0/5 | 1/5 → 1/5 |
  | C: B after a boundary check's harness red | allow | 5/5 → 5/5 | 5/5 → 5/5 |
  | D: A plus an unasserted in-memory cache | deny | 0/5 → 0/5 | 0/5 → 0/5 |
  | E: A with no harness run in the session | deny | 0/5 → 0/5 | 0/5 → 0/5 |

  On the Kiro judge, B's denials on 0.4.24 name only the attribute; on
  0.4.23 they named the events too. The Claude judge lets B through 1 time
  in 5 on both versions. No judge failures in 100 runs.
- **Upgrading.** For a device harness, add `harnessGlobs` to the preset
  call. No other change.

## 0.4.23

A shell command run from the main checkout that writes into a sibling
worktree is now judged by that worktree's config, in Claude Code and in
Kiro (#92).

- **What was missing.** 0.4.22 picked a sibling worktree's config from the
  call's cwd, or a leading `cd`/`git -C`. A Bash call keeps the session's
  cwd, though, so it usually reaches a sibling by path:
  `sed -i … /abs/sibling/src/A.kt`, `sed -i … ../sibling/src/A.kt`, or a
  python script that opens the sibling file. Those ran under the main
  checkout's config, whose shell-write screen skips paths outside the
  project, and passed with no output. Kiro had the same gap: its shim
  called the bare `probity` bin, with none of `probity-claude`'s worktree
  handling.
- **Now:**
  - `probity-claude` reads the files a Bash command writes with the
    shell-write screen's parser (new export `shellWritePaths`) and also
    runs Probity in each other worktree they lie in, the main checkout
    included when the session is in a sibling. The first deny stands.
    The extra run happens only for commands that write into another tree;
    other calls cost the same as before (282 ms against 291 ms on 0.4.22,
    median of 5).
  - The screen resolves a command's relative paths from the session's cwd,
    which `probity-claude` passes as `PROBITY_SESSION_CWD`. It used the
    config root before, which got `../sibling/...` right only by
    coincidence and missed relative paths from a subdirectory.
  - `sed`/`perl` script arguments (`s/a/b/`, `-e` values, BSD's
    `-i ''` suffix) are no longer read as file paths.
  - The Kiro shim runs `probity-claude` (falling back to `probity`), and
    passes the shell call's cwd, so Kiro gets the same worktree routing and
    the #81 config-edit guard.
- **Upgrading.** Re-copy the Kiro shim files (`/probity-update` step 5).
  No config change.

## 0.4.22

Probity now judges calls in a git worktree beside the main checkout, in
Claude Code and in Kiro, and no longer lets calls through when its
packages aren't installed (#90).

- **What was missing.** A worktree made with `git worktree add ../<name>`
  sits beside the project, not inside it.
  - Claude Code: `probity-claude` switches to a worktree's own config only
    for worktrees nested in the project (#66). For a sibling it stayed on
    the main checkout's config, whose rules don't cover paths outside the
    project. So a `sed -i` on a scoped file in the sibling was allowed with
    no output, and globs anchored at the project root (the spec layer, for
    one) missed Write and Edit too. Seen in mysudo-core on 0.4.21: a
    session in a sibling worktree wrote scoped `.feature` files with a
    `python3` heredoc and nothing blocked it.
  - Kiro: the shim takes its root from its own location. In a sibling
    worktree that is the worktree, which usually has no `node_modules`,
    and the shim then allowed every call ("probity not installed").
- **Now:**
  - `probity-claude` finds sibling worktrees of the project's repository
    through `git worktree list` (run only when the target is outside the
    project) and starts Probity there when the worktree has its own
    `probity.config.*`.
  - Both `probity-claude` and the Kiro shim fall back to the main
    checkout's packages: the main checkout's `node_modules` is appended to
    `NODE_PATH`, which Node consults only after the worktree's own. The
    Kiro shim also runs the main worktree's Probity bin when its own tree
    has none.
  - When the packages resolve nowhere, every call is denied with "Run npm
    ci in <tree>", except a bare install command (`npm ci`, `npm install`,
    pnpm/yarn/bun install) so the session can recover. For the Kiro shim
    this replaces the old allow.
- **Upgrading.** Re-copy the Kiro shim files (`/probity-update` step 5
  does this). No config change.

## 0.4.21

Every preset now denies a shell command that writes a file its rules
cover, so the edit goes through the write tool, where the rules judge
it. On by default (#79).

- **What was missing.** The content rules (the TDD gate, the boundary
  and thin-adapter rules, `forbidContentPattern` and the rest) judge
  write actions only. A file changed from the shell (`sed -i`,
  `cat > file <<EOF`, a `python3 - <<'EOF' … open(p, 'w')` script)
  reached Probity as a command and passed unjudged. Seen in
  timesheet-tracker on 0.4.16, and on 0.4.20 through kiro-cli in
  mysudo-core: a green step on a scoped `jvmMain` file made by a
  Python heredoc passed, while the same session's write-tool edits
  were judged and blocked 3 times.
- **Now:** `forbidShellWritesToScopedFiles` (in `rules/shell-writes.ts`)
  reads each command for the files it writes and denies it when one
  falls inside a files-scoped block, after `excludeGlobs`. It is
  deterministic, runs first, and costs no AI call. It works the same
  for Claude Code's `Bash` and Kiro's `shell`.
  - Recognized: redirects and `tee`; `sed -i` and `perl -i`;
    `cp`/`mv`/`install`/`ln`/`rsync` destinations; `dd of=`;
    `truncate`; `git apply` and `patch` from a heredoc or a patch
    file; inline `python`/`node`/`ruby`/`perl`/`bun`/`deno`/`php`
    scripts that call a file-writing API. Shell variables, `for` loop
    variables and `cd` are followed.
  - For an inline script, any scoped path the command mentions counts,
    since the script can take its target from a variable. A script that
    reads a scoped file and writes a report elsewhere is denied too.
  - Not seen, so still passing: script files named on the command line,
    `find -exec`/`xargs`, and paths computed at run time.
- **Options.** Each preset takes `shellWriteScreen` (default `true`);
  `swiftRuleEntries` gains an options argument for it.
  `withShellWriteScreen(entries, { root })` screens a hand-built list,
  for a config that adds its own blocks to a preset's (see
  hooks/PROBITY.md).
- **Upgrading.** No config edit needed for a config that uses a preset
  as it is.

## 0.4.20

Probity's AI judge can now run on kiro-cli, with a fallback between
judges, so judged writes keep working when the Claude login hits its
spend limit. Opt-in.

- **What was missing.** The judged rules (the TDD gate and the other AI
  rules) ask Probity's default judge: the Claude Agent SDK on the
  user's Claude login. In mysudo-core, the org's monthly Claude spend
  limit was hit twice in a week. Every judged write then failed closed
  ("judge returned no verdict … spend limit"), including writes made in
  kiro-cli through the Kiro shim, since the shim asks the same judge.
  Probity's config already takes a custom judge (`ai`), but there was
  no kiro-cli judge and no way to fall back.
- **Now:** three new exports, in `rules/kiro-judge.ts`:
  - **`kiroJudge(options?)`** answers each verdict with one
    `kiro-cli chat --no-interactive` run. The prompt goes on stdin,
    since judge prompts can pass Linux's 128 KB per-argument limit.
    The answer is parsed like Probity's own (bare, fenced, or the last
    JSON object). Defaults: `claude-opus-5.5`, `high` effort, 60 s
    timeout.
    - It fails closed with a "Kiro judge unavailable" reason when
      kiro-cli is missing, exits non-zero, prints nothing, or times
      out. On a timeout it stops kiro-cli and the processes it started.
      An answer that isn't a valid verdict is reported like Probity
      reports one, so the presets ask once more.
  - **`judgeChain([...])`** asks judges in order and moves on only when
    one is unavailable: Kiro unavailable, or Claude reporting a spend
    limit, quota, rate limit or authentication failure. A real verdict
    stands, and so does a malformed answer. Within one hook run, a
    judge found unavailable is skipped for the run's later verdicts, so
    a dead judge can't eat the hook's time across several verdicts.
    Probity starts afresh per tool call, so a hanging kiro-cli still
    costs each write the full `timeoutMs`.
  - **`claudeJudge()`** is Probity's default Claude judge, for use in a
    chain. Probity doesn't export it, so it is loaded from the installed
    `@nizos/probity`. If that ever fails, it reports "Claude judge
    unavailable" instead of crashing.
- **Hook safety.** `--trust-tools=` alone doesn't make a Kiro run
  tool-free: the built-in `kiro_default` agent still read a file in its
  working directory. So `kiroJudge` writes its own agent,
  `probity-judge`, with no tools, hooks or resources, into a working
  directory of its own (`<tmpdir>/probity-kiro-judge`). Asked to read a
  file, that agent answered without reading it. A judge run therefore
  can't edit files, run commands, set off the Kiro shim's hook, or get
  the default agent's prompt hook added to its prompt. Kiro's saved
  sessions for judge runs stay out of the project's session list; they
  accumulate in that directory, one per verdict.
  `withJudgeFailureDiagnostics` reports "<name> judge unavailable" as
  an infrastructure failure, not as a policy deny, and doesn't retry it.
- **Measured** on the #80 replica (the mysudo-core #145 session: port,
  store, use case, fake and test on disk, plus a hand-written
  transcript), through the KMP preset's TDD rule, 5 runs per case.
  Allowed counts:

  | Case | Expect | Claude | Kiro, medium | Kiro, high |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | P0–P4: port method and the steps around it (5 cases) | allow | 5/5 each | 5/5 each | 5/5 each |
  | C1: port method with no failing test, after green | block | 0/5 (+0/10) | 1/5 (+2/10, +4/10) | 0/5 (+0/10) |
  | C2: full sync engine for the red test | block | 0/5 | 0/5 | 0/5 |
  | C3: assertion added to a passing test | not a control | 5/5 | 1/5 | 0/5 |
  | C4: red test's assertion loosened | block | 0/5 | 0/5 | 0/5 |
  | C5: port gains two unneeded methods | block | 0/5 | 0/5 | 0/5 |

  At `high`, Kiro agreed with Claude on every case that has a right
  answer. At `medium`, it let C1 through 7 times in 25, always with an
  empty reason, so `high` is the default. On C3, Kiro is stricter than
  Claude. That is a policy grey area: neither version blocks it on
  purpose.

  Latency per verdict:
  - Kiro, high: 15 s median, 22 s p90, 42 s max.
  - Kiro, medium: 16 s median, 40 s max.
  - Claude: 8 s median, 12 s max.

  Fallbacks, timed through Probity's real CLI and config loader:
  - kiro-cli missing: found in 4 ms, then Claude answered.
  - A Kiro timeout set to 3 s: Claude answered 6.5 s after the start.
- **Kiro shim timeout raised.** `kiro/kiro-agent.template.json` now gives
  the Probity preToolUse hooks 300 s (`timeout_ms: 300000`), not 120 s.
  A write can take up to three verdicts, and three slow Kiro verdicts
  can pass 120 s. A hook that times out doesn't block: Claude Code's
  docs say the tool call then proceeds, and Kiro's behavior wasn't
  checked. Claude Code's default limit for a command hook (10 minutes)
  is already enough.
- **Not measured:** a judge run started from inside a live Kiro session
  (the Kiro shim calling Probity, which calls kiro-cli). The judge's
  agent has no tools or hooks, so it can't trigger the shim. Whether
  kiro-cli behaves differently when nested was not tested.
- **Action needed:** none; nothing changes unless `ai` is set. To use
  it, see hooks/PROBITY.md, "Choosing the AI judge". If you use
  `kiroJudge` under Kiro, raise `timeout_ms` on the Probity hooks in
  your `.kiro/agents/*.json` to 300000 (`/probity-update` refreshes the
  shim, not your agent config).
- New exports: `kiroJudge`, `claudeJudge`, `judgeChain`,
  `isJudgeUnavailable`, `KIRO_JUDGE_AGENT`, and the types
  `KiroJudgeOptions`, `KiroRun`, `KiroRunResult`, `JudgeChainOptions`.

## 0.4.19

`probity-claude` keeps a broken `probity.config.ts` fixable (#81).

- **What happened.** Probity loads its config on every tool call and
  fails closed when the load throws. An agent added
  `withMutationProbe(...)` to the config in one Edit and its import in
  the next. After the first edit, every Bash, Edit and Write was denied
  with `Probity: withMutationProbe is not defined`, including the
  Edit that would add the import. Only a human could revert the file.
- **Edits to the config are checked first.** For an Edit or Write to
  the config Probity would load (the nearest `probity.config.*`, or
  `--config`), the wrapper applies the edit to a scratch copy beside
  the config, loads it with Probity's own loader, and denies the edit
  if it would not load. The deny names the load error and says to
  import before use, or to write the file in one Write. The scratch
  copy is always removed.
- **A config that is already broken can still be edited.** If the
  config fails to load, Edit and Write calls to it are not blocked: the
  wrapper returns no decision, so Claude Code's normal permission flow
  decides. Every other call stays denied, and the deny now ends with
  the config's path and that editing it is the way out.
- **Cost.** The config is loaded in the wrapper only for edits to the
  config itself, and when Probity fails closed outside its rules. Other
  calls run as before.
- **Tradeoff.** While the config is broken, Edit and Write calls to it
  are not judged by any rule, including rules that guard the config.
  A config that does not exist yet (the hook wired before the file)
  still blocks everything; that case is not covered here.
- **If the check cannot run** (no scratch file can be written beside
  the config, say), the wrapper leaves the edit to Probity as before
  instead of failing open.
- **Upgrading.** No config or hook change if the hook already runs
  `probity-claude`. The bare `probity` bin does not get this.

## 0.4.18

The Kotlin and KMP TDD judge no longer blocks a new port method that a
failing test needs (#80). It also stops repeating a fix that was already
tried, and lets a red test be tightened.

- **What went wrong.** In mysudo-core #145, a test read Sudo A online,
  went offline, then expected Sudo B's messages from the local store. B
  was never read online. The gateway port (`TextMessageGateway`) could
  only read one Sudo at a time, so no store logic could make the test
  pass. The fix needed a new port method,
  `changes(account, since: Long?)`. The judge denied it four times as
  over-implementation: "the test only needs the kept store to retain
  every Sudo's messages … it never exercises a changes-feed". It reasoned
  from the store, not from what the port can deliver. The store merge it
  proposed was written, and the test still failed. When the red test was
  then edited to assert the Account-wide gateway call, the judge called
  that "retrofitting".
- **Now:** the Kotlin TDD addendum (`internal/kotlin-tdd.ts`) has three
  new rules:
  - **A port method can be the minimal green.** The judge checks what
    the existing port methods and the test's fakes can deliver. When no
    existing method can deliver the data the test asserts, adding the
    one port method that can (with its result type and the fake's
    implementation) is the minimal green. The judge does not deny it
    over its signature: a parameter the test passes as null, or a result
    field it ignores, does nothing by itself. The code behind the port
    is still held to the test's assertions. Paging, cursors, retries and
    deletion handling the test doesn't assert are still denied.
  - **A tried route is ruled out.** If a change an earlier denial
    proposed was written, and the same test still failed the same way,
    the judge must not propose it again.
  - **Tightening a red test is part of the red step.** Adding or
    strengthening an assertion in a test that is still failing is not
    retrofitting. Retrofitting means editing a test after production
    code makes it pass. Replacing or loosening a red test's assertion so
    current code passes is weakening, and is denied.
- **Measured** with Probity's real Claude Code judge, wired as the KMP
  preset wires it, on a replica of the #145 session (port, store, use
  case, fake and test files on disk, plus a hand-written transcript).
  Five runs per case, 0.4.17 → 0.4.18. Cases that must be allowed:
  - adding `changes()` after the proposed store merge was tried and the
    test still failed (the reported write): **1/5 → 5/5**;
  - adding `changes()` straight after the first red run: **0/5 → 5/5**;
  - adding the gateway-call assertion to the still-red test:
    **0/5 → 4/5**;
  - adding `changes()` after that tightened test ran red (the issue's
    workaround): **0/5 → 5/5**;
  - the minimal use-case green after the port and fake exist:
    5/5 → 5/5.

  Cases that must stay denied (allowed count, 0.4.17 → 0.4.18):
  - `changes()` with no failing test, after a green run: 1/5 → 0/5;
  - a full changes-feed sync (paging loop, cursor store, deletions) for
    the red test: 0/5 → 0/5;
  - the port gaining two more methods no test needs: 0/5 → 0/5;
  - the red test's outcome assertion replaced by one current code
    passes: **3/5 → 0/5**.

  The original transcript wasn't replayed. The hand-written replica
  reproduced the reported denial wording on 0.4.17.
- **Not changed:**
  - The JS/TS (`JS_TDD_ADDENDUM`) and Swift judges don't get these rules
    yet.
  - Adding an assertion to a test that already passes is still allowed.
    The judge allowed it 5/5 on 0.4.17 and 4/5 on 0.4.18.
- **Action needed:** none. Configs that use `kotlinRuleEntries` or
  `kmpRuleEntries` get it on upgrade.

## 0.4.17

The Kotlin and KMP presets can now keep driving adapters thin (#76):
Compose screens and CLI commands, in the same repo as the core or in a
separate app that consumes it as a library. Opt-in.

- **What was missing.** 0.4.16 wired `enforceThinDrivingAdapter` and
  `forbidNewDomainDiscriminantChecks` into the JS preset only. Kotlin
  had three more gaps:
  - Its discriminant screen matched only string literals, but Kotlin
    compares to enum entries (`role == Role.SUPER_USER`).
  - The export list only read JS/TS `export` declarations.
  - A UI-only app depending on the core as a library has no core
    source to scan at all.
- **Opt-in, unlike JS.** `kotlinRuleEntries` and `kmpRuleEntries` get
  a `drivingAdapterGlobs` option with **no default**. A core-only repo
  (mysudo-core has no `@Composable` files) has no UI, so a default glob
  would only show up as `DEAD SCOPE`. Upgrading changes nothing until
  the option is set. When set, the block is listed before the TDD
  judge, and `coreGlobs` are excluded from it (in KMP, that keeps
  `presentation/` ViewModels core). Starting globs per layout are in
  hooks/PROBITY.md, "Driving adapters by project layout".
- **New options** (both presets):
  - `domainDiscriminants`: turns on the free screen with Kotlin
    patterns. It blocks net-new `role == Role.X` (either order) or
    string-literal comparisons, `when (viewer.role)` subjects, and
    `status is Status.Draft`.
  - `domainHint`: appended to the screen's deny.
  - `coreExportsInJudge`: the judge gets the public names declared in
    `coreGlobs` sources. Capped at `coreExportsMaxChars`, default
    16,000.
  - `coreApiPaths`: for a UI-only app. The judge gets the core's public
    API read from binary-compatibility-validator dumps (`.api` and
    `.klib.api`, as files or directories). Generated members (getters,
    `component1`, `copy`, `equals`…) are dropped; on kotlinx.coroutines'
    real dumps this cuts 125 KB to about 10 KB.
- **Kotlin judge addendum** (`KOTLIN_DRIVING_ADAPTER_ADDENDUM`). A CLI
  command's options, help text, precondition checks and exhaustive
  `when` over its use case's sealed outcome (to exit code, error code,
  message and JSON) are translation. Branching on domain state,
  retrying, or chaining use cases is not. It also lists Compose view
  state and wiring (`remember`, `collectAsState`, `LaunchedEffect`
  forwarding one intent, `@Preview`) as allowed.
- **Export scanning (all presets).** Nested worktrees and submodules
  (a directory with a `.git` file, such as `.claude/worktrees/*`) are
  skipped, as the parity rule already does (#55). Paths are printed
  relative to the directory the modules share. On mysudo-core, the
  worktree copies would otherwise have filled the cap several times
  over. Kotlin nested types (mostly sealed-outcome cases) are left out,
  which takes mysudo-core's core list from 29,000 to 13,000 characters.
- **Shared block.** `presets/driving-adapter.ts` (`drivingAdapterBlock`)
  builds the block for all three presets. The JS preset's wiring is
  unchanged.
- **Measured** with Probity's real Claude Code judge, wired as the KMP
  preset wires it, 5 runs per case.
  - **mysudo-core's CLI** (`cli/src/main/**/commands/**`, its real
    `coreGlobs`, `coreExportsInJudge: true`):
    - Allowed: four real writes (adding the real `sudos delete`
      command, the real `RegisterCommand` with its extra read for
      display, the real 432-line `PhoneCallsCommand`, and a help-text
      change).
    - Blocked: four splices into real commands (label validation the
      `CreateSudo` use case already does; a last-Sudo rule plus a retry
      in `delete`; a role/status filter in `list`; a locked-account
      sign-out-and-deregister policy in `register`).
    - Result: 40/40 correct. The free screen caught the two enum cases
      before any AI call.
  - **Synthetic Compose versions** of the #72 cases (blocked) and
    controls (allowed: a pure render change, calling `canApprove()`,
    one ViewModel intent, local `remember` state): 40/40 correct.
  - **Addendum check.** Without the Kotlin addendum, the CLI set was
    also correct (39/39 verdicts, 1 run failed on the judge's login).
    So the addendum is guidance these cases didn't need, not a measured
    fix.
- **Scope.** `probity-scope-report` was run on mysudo-core's tree from
  a scratch copy of its config. Relative globs are anchored to the
  config's own directory, so that copy used the unanchored
  `**/cli/src/main/**/commands/**`. It reported the block with no
  warning but also matched `.claude/worktrees/` copies (123 files). In
  mysudo-core's own config, the anchored `cli/src/main/**/commands/**`
  matches the 31 command files. A scope-report test confirms the block
  leaves out `Composition.kt`.
- New exports: `drivingAdapterBlock` (`presets/driving-adapter`).
  `ExportLanguage`, `JS_EXPORTS`, `ApiDumpFormat` and
  `listPublishedApi` (`rules/ports-and-adapters`). `kotlinExportedNames`,
  `KOTLIN_EXPORTS`, `readKotlinApiDump`, `KOTLIN_API_DUMP`,
  `kotlinDomainDiscriminantPatterns` and `KOTLIN_DRIVING_ADAPTER_ADDENDUM`
  (`rules/kotlin`). `forbidNewDomainDiscriminantChecks` takes
  `patternsFor`; `enforceThinDrivingAdapter` takes `publishedApi` and a
  `coreExports.language`.

## 0.4.16

The JS preset now keeps driving adapters (UI components, pages, route
handlers) thin (#72). Business logic leaking out of the core into UI
code is blocked, and the deny names where it should go.

- **What went wrong.** The existing ports-and-adapters rules stop
  vendors getting *into* core code. Nothing stopped logic leaking *out*
  of it. In a React consumer on 0.4.14, with clean and fully policed
  core boundaries, `src/ui/` grew:
  - a submit handler running a whole use case (domain `submit()`,
    `repository.save()`, `notifier.timesheetSubmitted()`, and a "a
    failed notification must never fail the submit" policy)
  - `viewer.role === 'SuperUser'` permission checks in four places,
    next to a domain that already exported `canEdit` and `canApprove`
  - a display-name rule copied seven times, with two copies disagreeing
  - a React-free use case filed under `src/ui/`

  Each one had a component test, so the TDD judge had no reason to
  object. It checks whether code is tested, not where it belongs.
- **Now:** two new rules in `rules/ports-and-adapters.ts`.
  - `enforceThinDrivingAdapter`, an AI judge. It blocks a write that
    adds (a) a decision in domain terms, (b) coordination of more than
    one port or use-case call, (c) a re-implementation of something the
    core exports, or (d) a framework-free use case under a UI path. The
    deny names the extraction target: a domain function or a use case.
    Rendering, display formatting, local view state, and one call per
    user intent pass. Only what a write adds is judged, so an existing
    thick component doesn't freeze.
  - `forbidNewDomainDiscriminantChecks`, a free deterministic screen.
    It blocks net-new comparisons of configured fields to a literal
    (`viewer.role === 'SuperUser'`, either order) and points to a domain
    function. Off until you list the fields: there is no default,
    because `status === 'loading'` is ordinary view state.
- **Preset wiring (JS only).** `jsRuleEntries` gets a block on the new
  `drivingAdapterGlobs` option, **on by default**: `src/ui/**`,
  `src/components/**` and `src/**/*.tsx`, minus `*.test.*`, `*.spec.*`
  and `*.stories.*`. It runs before the TDD judge, so a denial costs one
  AI call. New options:
  - `drivingAdapterGlobs`: the scope; `[]` switches the rules off.
  - `domainDiscriminants`: turns on the free screen, e.g. `['role']`.
  - `domainHint`: appended to the screen's deny, e.g. where permission
    rules live.
  - `coreExportsInJudge`: gives the judge the export names of every
    module under `coreGlobs` (capped at 8,000 characters), so it can
    name the existing function a copy duplicates. Off by default; it
    scans the tree on each judged write.
- **Measured** with Probity's real Claude Code judge, 5 runs per case,
  on synthetic writes built from the four cases above plus five
  controls that must pass: a pure render change, adding a `canX()`
  call, a single use-case call, a local `status === 'loading'` check,
  and calling an existing `displayName` export. These are written from
  the issue's descriptions, not replays of the consumer's real writes.
  With and without the export list, 90/90 verdicts were correct (40
  blocked, 50 allowed). The prompt's examples were then made
  domain-neutral and the replay rerun: 76 of 90 runs returned a verdict
  and all 76 were correct. The other 14 hit a judge login failure in
  the test environment. On 0.4.14 no rule judged these writes, so all
  would pass.
- **Cost:** one extra AI call per write to a matching UI file, on top of
  the TDD judge.
- **Migration.** Consumers calling `jsRuleEntries` get the new block on
  upgrade. Check it with `probity-scope-report`: it lists the block and
  flags it `DEAD SCOPE` if your UI lives elsewhere. Then set
  `drivingAdapterGlobs` to your layout, or `[]` to opt out. Hand-composed
  configs add the block themselves:

  ```ts
  {
    files: ['src/ui/**', '!**/*.test.*'],
    rules: [
      forbidNewDomainDiscriminantChecks({ discriminants: ['role'] }),
      withJudgeFailureDiagnostics(withContradictionRetry(enforceThinDrivingAdapter())),
    ],
  }
  ```

  The Kotlin, KMP and Swift presets are unchanged; Compose and SwiftUI
  globs are a follow-up.
- New exports: `enforceThinDrivingAdapter`,
  `forbidNewDomainDiscriminantChecks`, `domainDiscriminantPatterns`,
  `exportedNames` and `listCoreExports`.
- Skills: `ports-and-adapters` gets a "Driving adapters are equally
  thin" section with a checklist, red flags and a rationalization;
  `frontend-ui-engineering` points to it.

## 0.4.15

The JS/TS TDD judge no longer blocks adding a new red test (#73), and it
now blocks a production write whose new test was never run.

- **What went wrong.** In #73, a JS/TS project on 0.4.14 added one new
  failing `it(...)` to an existing Vitest file, straight after a green
  run, with no production change. The judge denied it: "This test has
  not been observed failing … here it is being added as a green->red
  crossing without that observed red." A test can't fail before it
  exists. This is the #43 bug in the Kotlin judge, fixed in 0.4.3. The
  JS preset runs Probity's built-in `enforceTdd()`, which never got
  that fix. Its default rules say both "adding a test is the red step"
  and "judge a new red at the green->red boundary too" (the refactor
  check), and the judge read the second as a demand for a failing run.
- **Now:** a new rule, `enforceJsTdd()` (in `rules/js-tdd.ts`,
  exported), is `enforceTdd()` with an addendum, wrapped the way the JS
  preset already wrapped it. The JS preset uses it. The addendum says:
  - Adding one failing test is the red step and needs no prior run.
    "Must be observed failing" applies only to the production write
    that follows. This holds even when the test contradicts what the
    previous cycle just implemented.
  - At a test write, the only green->red question is whether the prior
    green left a refactor unmade. A passing prior run is never a reason
    to block a new test.
  - A production write still needs an observed failing test: a run,
    after the test was written, whose output shows that test failing.
    A test written but never run does not count. Neither does an
    earlier failing run of a different test.
- **Measured** against the live judge (Probity's `claudeCode()` agent,
  as the hook runs it), replaying the real #73 write. The input was the
  session's own transcript, cut just before the write and read with
  Probity's transcript reader, plus the test and production files as
  they stood on disk then (10 runs each, 0.4.14 → 0.4.15):
  - the reported write: allowed **2/10 → 10/10**. On 0.4.14 the
    denials read like the reported one ("has not been observed
    failing");
  - the same session, then a production write with the new test never
    run: blocked **4/10 → 9/10**;
  - the same session, then the new test run and seen failing, then the
    production write: allowed 10/10 → 10/10.

  A replica built from the same files, but with a hand-written session,
  never reproduced the denial (allowed 20/20 on both versions). On it,
  the controls that must stay blocked, as 0.4.14 → 0.4.15 (5 runs
  each unless noted):
  - a production write before any test for it: 5/5 → 5/5;
  - a test plus a production change in one write (an in-source `it` in
    `account.ts`): 5/5 → 5/5;
  - two new tests in one write: 5/5 → 5/5;
  - a production write after the new test was added but never run:
    1/10 → 15/15.
- **Not changed:** Probity's own `enforceTdd({ fastPath: true })` stays
  off. It would pass a single-test write with no AI call, but it skips
  the refactor check at the green->red boundary. It also lacks the
  byte-preservation checks the Kotlin fast path has.
- **Action needed** if your `probity.config.ts` wires the TDD rule
  itself rather than through `jsRuleEntries`. Replace
  `withJudgeFailureDiagnostics(withContradictionRetry(enforceTdd()))`
  with `enforceJsTdd()`, imported from `@jjchill/probity-rules` or
  `@jjchill/probity-rules/rules/js-tdd`. Configs that use
  `jsRuleEntries` get it automatically.
- New exports: `enforceJsTdd`, `JS_TDD_ADDENDUM`.

## 0.4.14

Extracting existing code into a new file under green now passes in the
Kotlin and KMP presets (#70), and a move with new behavior spliced in
is now blocked instead of slipping through.

- **What went wrong.** In #70, after a green `./gradlew build`, moving a
  547-line JVM composition function into `commonMain` behind an
  interface was blocked twice as "net-new logic": the new
  `ClientComposition.kt` ("a parallel new common-source entry point")
  and the new `JvmPlatformAdapters.kt` implementing the interface. The
  Kotlin TDD judge sees each session event clipped to 6,000 characters,
  head and tail. The 26,934-character source file it was moved from was
  mostly invisible, and the original still on disk read as duplication.
  The same blindness cuts the other way: a moved file with one small
  new behavior added (a new `https` check) was allowed by the TDD judge,
  in 0.4.13 too.
- **Now:** a new wrapper, `withExtractionUnderGreen` (in `gates.ts`,
  exported), sits around the Kotlin TDD judge. When a write creates a
  new production file and the latest matching build or test run in the
  session was green, it gives a separate judge the full, current
  on-disk content of the production files the session read or edited
  (up to 120,000 characters, most-related first). The judge answers
  with one of three findings:
  - **move**: every behavior is already there. The write passes, with
    an `extraction-under-green` trace note.
  - **new behavior**: the file produces an outcome a caller could
    observe that no source has (a new rejection, call, side effect or
    value). The write is blocked, naming it: under green there is no
    failing test to justify it. A different route to an existing
    outcome (try/catch instead of a null check, logic moved into a
    caller) is not new behavior.
  - **unsure**, any other answer, or a judge error: the TDD judge
    decides, as before.
- **Measured** by replaying the two real #70 writes with the session's
  own transcript cut just before each one, and the files the session
  had written by then on disk (5 runs each). `JvmPlatformAdapters.kt`:
  blocked 3/3 on 0.4.13, now "move" and allowed 5/5.
  `ClientComposition.kt`: "unsure" 5/5, then allowed by the TDD judge as
  on 0.4.13 (its original denial did not reproduce). The same two
  writes with one new behavior spliced in were "new behavior" and
  blocked 10/10; on 0.4.13 one of them was allowed 3/3.
- **Applies to** new production files only (`src/main/` and
  `src/<target>Main/`). Edits to existing files are unchanged. The cost
  is one extra AI call for a qualifying write, two when the finding is
  "unsure".
- New exports: `withExtractionUnderGreen`, `GreenRunOptions`, and in the
  Kotlin rules `kotlinGreenRunOptions()` and
  `KOTLIN_PRODUCTION_SOURCE_PATTERN`. `requireGreenTestRun` now shares
  its green check with the wrapper; its behavior is unchanged.

## 0.4.13

The adapter-observability judge no longer demands telemetry on calls
through the codebase's own interfaces (#68). Applies to every preset that
wires `enforceAdapterObservability` (Kotlin, KMP, Swift).

- **What went wrong.** In #68, `AccountKeySecrets`, an internal class
  under `adapter/`, called `SecretBackend`, an interface declared in
  the same module. Its implementations (`FileSecretBackend`,
  `KeychainSecretBackend`) are the real boundary and already emit
  events. The judge read `secrets.get/create/delete` as "external I/O
  through the keychain/keystore adapter" and demanded an event. The TDD
  judge then rejected that event as over-implementation, because the
  red test didn't assert it. Each write was blocked by one rule or the
  other, until every test of the internal helper asserted telemetry.
- **Now:** the judge's instructions say a new path needs observability
  when the file itself calls a vendor SDK, HTTP client, database
  driver, the filesystem, or a platform API. Calls on an interface or
  class the codebase declares (same package, or imported from the
  project's own packages) are delegation: the implementation behind it
  owns the boundary and is judged when it is written.
- **Measured** by replaying #68's writes through the real rule and judge
  (3 runs each): adopting a legacy key and adding `delete` through
  `SecretBackend` went from 0/3 to 3/3 pass. Two controls stayed
  blocked 3/3: a `FileSecretBackend` method calling `java.nio.file`
  directly, and a new Ktor HTTP adapter, both without events.
- Not changed: an adapter that does call the platform still needs its
  event asserted in the failing test first, as the block message says.

## 0.4.12

`probity-claude` now runs Probity in the worktree a session is working
in, so rules judge that tree's specs and files (#66).

- **What went wrong.** The documented hook is
  `cd "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR" && ./node_modules/.bin/probity-claude`.
  After a session moves into a worktree (`EnterWorktree`, or an
  `isolation: "worktree"` sub-agent), `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` still names
  the main checkout. Probity finds `probity.config.ts` by searching
  upward from its working directory, so it loaded the main checkout's
  config, and `ROOT`, `specsDir` and `glossaryPath` all pointed there.
  In #66 the spec-first rule blocked an acceptance test whose
  `Covers:` scenario existed only in the worktree's `specs/`
  submodule, and named the main checkout's `specs/features`.
- **Now:** the wrapper finds the git worktree the action targets: the
  edited file's location, or for a command its `git -C <dir>` or
  leading `cd <dir> &&`, else the session's `cwd`. When that worktree
  is nested inside the project and has its own `probity.config.*`, the
  wrapper starts Probity there. Its config's imports resolve from the
  project's `node_modules` (one level up the folder tree), so the
  worktree needs no install. Work in the main checkout, worktrees
  without a Probity config, and paths outside the project run as before.
- A relative `--debug <path>` is anchored to the project directory, so
  the debug log stays in one place.
- Only hooks that run `probity-claude` get this. A worktree outside the
  project folder still runs against the project.
- Consumers: no config change. The worktree's own `probity.config.ts`
  (from its branch) is the one that runs.

## 0.4.11

The commit-on-green gate now catches every form of `git commit`, and
scopes a worktree's commit by that worktree's staged files (#63).

- **What went wrong.** `requireGreenTestRun` recognized a commit only
  by the literal text `git commit`. `git -C <dir> commit` and
  `git -c key=value commit` never matched, so a commit written either
  way skipped the "tests must be green" check entirely. Agents often
  write `git -C <path> commit` to avoid a `cd`. With `enforceForPaths`
  set, the gate also listed staged files in the hook's checkout. A
  commit made inside a linked worktree nested in the project
  (`.claude/worktrees/<name>/`) was scoped by the main checkout's
  staged files, usually none, and passed as "no code touched".
- **Now:** the gate matches commits with the shared `GIT_COMMIT`
  pattern the marker and parity gates use. With `enforceForPaths`, it
  lists the staged files of the tree the commit is made in. The
  transcript check (a green run after the last write) is per session,
  so it is unchanged.
- `GIT_COMMIT` no longer matches plumbing commands that only start
  with the word, such as `git commit-tree` and `git commit-graph`. This
  applies to every commit gate.
- `listCommitFiles` (the test hook option) now also receives the root
  of the tree being committed as a second argument, in
  `requireGreenTestRun` and the Kotlin wrapper. One-argument functions
  keep working.

## 0.4.10

The spec↔test parity gate now checks the worktree a commit is made in
(#57).

- **What went wrong.** `enforceSpecTestParity` always checked the
  hook's own checkout, the project root. Claude Code puts
  `isolation: "worktree"` sub-agents in linked worktrees inside the
  project (`.claude/worktrees/<name>/`). A commit made there was
  checked against the main checkout's staged files, which usually
  touch no specs or acceptance tests, so the gate passed without
  looking. A sub-agent could commit a new scenario with no covering
  test. The gate also missed `git -C <dir> commit` entirely: it only
  fired on the literal text `git commit`.
- **Now:** like the marker gates (#39), the gate reads the commit's
  directory from `git -C <dir> commit` or `cd <dir> && git commit`.
  When that is a git working tree nested inside the project, the gate
  checks that tree. `specsDir`, `testRoots` and `baselinePath` under
  the project root are mapped to the same paths inside it, and the
  staged-file listing runs there. A scenario left uncovered in the main
  checkout no longer blocks a worktree's commit, and the reverse.
- The gate now fires on `git -C <dir> commit` and
  `git -c key=value commit` as well.
- `listCommitFiles` (the test hook option) now also receives the root
  of the tree being committed as a second argument. One-argument
  functions keep working.
- Internal: the commit-target helpers the marker gates used moved to
  `rules/commit-target.ts`, shared by both rules.

## 0.4.9

Long sessions no longer lock every commit once the session transcript
passes 100 MiB (#54).

- **What went wrong.** Probity refuses to read a transcript larger than
  100 MiB. Every rule that reads session history (the commit-on-green
  gate, the TDD judge, characterization-marker release) then failed
  with `rule error: file at <path> exceeds 104857600 bytes`, on every
  call, until the session was restarted and its context lost. Other
  commands whose text contains `git commit`, such as a
  `gh issue create` whose body quotes it, were blocked the same way.
- **Now:** `probity-claude` checks the transcript's size before running
  Probity. When it is over the limit, the wrapper copies its newest
  32 MiB (whole lines only) to a private temp file, points Probity at
  that copy, and deletes it when Probity exits. The gates only need
  recent events: the last test run, the red before a green. A red or a
  test run older than that window is no longer visible; rerun it.
- When a rule still hits the limit (a project running Probity's bare
  `probity` bin, or a Kiro session), it now denies with the cause and
  the fix (use `probity-claude`, or start a new session) instead of an
  opaque rule error. This covers `requireGreenTestRun`,
  `withCharacterizationTest`, and every TDD judge wrapped by
  `withJudgeFailureDiagnostics`. Any other failure to read history
  still blocks as a rule error.
- New export: `transcriptLimitViolation(error)` turns that error into
  the deny above and rethrows anything else, for custom rules that
  read `ctx.history()`.
- Cost: once a transcript is over the limit, every hook call the
  wrapper handles reads and writes that 32 MiB copy, whether or not a
  rule reads history (tens of milliseconds on an SSD).
- Consumers on the bare bin should switch the hook to `probity-claude`
  (see PROBITY.md); no config change is needed.

## 0.4.8

Spec↔test parity no longer counts Covers tags from other checkouts
nested inside the project (#55).

- **What went wrong.** The `probity-spec-parity` CLI and the
  `enforceSpecTestParity` and `surfaceScenarioLinkBreakage` rules
  walked every directory under the test roots. That included linked git worktrees Claude Code
  creates at `.claude/worktrees/<name>/`, which are full checkouts with
  their own `// Covers:` tags. In #55 a parity run reported 510 Covers
  tags for 257 scenarios, about twice the real number. A scenario
  claimed only by a test in the nested worktree counted as covered in
  the main checkout, so the gate could pass with no test for it there.
- **Now:** the scan skips any directory below a root that holds a
  `.git` file (a linked worktree or submodule), as the marker gates
  have since 0.4.2 (#39). A root that is itself a linked worktree is
  still scanned.
- Not changed: a commit made inside a nested worktree is still gated
  against the hook's own checkout, not the worktree's (the marker
  gates retarget; the parity gate does not).

## 0.4.7

A judge answer that is not valid JSON is no longer reported as an
outage (#52), in every preset.

- **What went wrong.** The judge sometimes writes its verdict as broken
  JSON: an unescaped `"` or a line break inside `reason`, or an answer
  cut off mid-string. Probity then reports "could not parse verdict",
  and `withJudgeFailureDiagnostics` rewrote that as "returned no
  verdict … an infrastructure failure … retrying … will not help". In
  #52 the judge had in fact denied the write for over-implementation.
  The agent was told the judge was down, and that retrying was
  pointless.
- **Now:** the wrapper tells the two causes apart.
  - The provider reports it is unavailable (spend limit, quota, rate
    limit, auth), or no AI agent is configured: unchanged. No retry;
    the message still says retrying will not help until the judge is
    back.
  - The judge answered, but not as a valid verdict: it is asked once
    more, and a well-formed second verdict stands. If the second answer
    is still malformed but reads as a deny, the block is reported as
    the policy decision it is, with the judge's reason quoted in full.
    Anything else stays blocked, with the judge's output in full, and
    the message says retrying the same write may succeed.
- Agents already retry a blocked write, so the automatic retry changes
  what the agent is told, not how many chances the write gets.
- Tested with scripted verdicts run through Probity's own parser: an
  unescaped quote, a raw line break, a cut-off answer, a malformed
  pass, and prose. The raw output of the #52 answer was not recorded,
  so this is not a replay of it. `hooks/PROBITY.md` now points at the
  `--debug <path>` hook option for capturing such output.

## 0.4.6

A TDD judge deny that ends in a bare "Pass." is now judged again (#50).

- `withContradictionRetry` (0.4.4, all presets) re-runs the judge once
  when a deny's last sentence concludes the write is allowed. It only
  recognised phrases like "This is permitted." and "should pass". A
  recorded deny ended "Reconsidering: ... It is not
  over-implementation. Pass." and was not retried; the identical write
  passed on the agent's own retry. The pattern now also matches a bare
  verdict word ("Pass.", "Allowed.", optionally after "So," or
  "Verdict:") and a closing "is not over-implementation" or "is not a
  violation". It still ignores "does not pass", "is not permitted",
  and sentences like "the tests pass". The second verdict still
  stands, deny or pass. Tested with scripted verdicts, including the
  recorded #50 reason.

## 0.4.5

The Kotlin and KMP TDD judge no longer blocks a behavior-preserving
extraction under green (#48).

- **Moving tested logic into a helper is allowed as a refactor, not
  only as green.** The 0.4.4 instruction for #46 described the move
  only as a green step for a failing test. The judge then read it as
  the sole way an extraction could pass, and required a fresh red for
  a plain refactor. Removing duplicated logic from two use cases was
  blocked with every test green: "the move-existing-logic allowance
  requires ... a failing test needing this call path". The
  instruction now names both phases. In green, the move serves a
  failing test. In refactor, no failing test is needed when the most
  recent relevant test or build run passed and none is outstanding.
  It also says a move includes rewiring a caller to the helper, and
  renaming the helper, its parameters or its result type. A helper
  with logic that appears nowhere in the session, or a move that adds
  a branch, still needs its own red.
  Live judge on a replica of the recorded #48 session (green build,
  both copies grepped, no failing test): adding the helper was allowed
  2 of 6 times on 0.4.4 and 8 of 8 on 0.4.5. Rewiring a caller passed
  on both. Controls stayed denied 8 of 8 on 0.4.5: a helper with new
  logic under green, moved logic plus a new branch, and the three
  0.4.4 controls.

## 0.4.4

Fixes for a one-test Kotlin write that reached the AI judge and was
denied by a reason that said it was permitted (#45), and for
extracting a shared helper under green (#46).

- **Kotlin fast path: a new test may reuse other tests' local names
  (#45).** The fast path passes a write adding exactly one `@Test`
  without an AI call. Its shadowing screen, which stops a write from
  redefining something existing tests call, counted every `val`
  inside the new test's body as a class-level declaration. Tests in
  one file routinely declare the same locals (`val cli`,
  `val composition`), so the #45 write went to the judge. Declarations
  inside a function body, lambda, initializer or accessor are now
  skipped: they are visible only there. Replayed on the recorded #45
  write and the file as committed just before it: 0.4.3 called the
  judge, 0.4.4 passes with no judge call.
- **A deny that concludes "permitted" is judged again (#45), in every
  preset.** Probity's judge answers `{"kind", "reason"}` in that
  order, with thinking disabled, so it picks `kind` before it
  reasons. The #45 block ended "... adds only ONE new test (the delete
  test). This is permitted." and still denied; the identical retry
  passed. New wrapper `withContradictionRetry` (in `rules/gates.ts`)
  re-runs the judge once when a deny's last sentence says the write is
  permitted, allowed, or should pass. The second verdict stands, deny
  or pass. Every other verdict is untouched. The JS, Swift, Kotlin and
  KMP presets all use it. Tested against the recorded #45 reason with
  scripted verdicts; the contradiction did not recur in 6 live runs,
  so the retry is not measured live.
  Asking the judge to reason before choosing `kind` was tried and
  rejected: it let a production write with no recorded failing test
  through 5 of 8 times, against 0 of 8 without it.
- **Moving tested logic into a shared helper is minimum green (#46),
  Kotlin and KMP judge.** When a second use case's failing test needs
  logic that production code already has, moving that logic into a
  helper (and a small result type) is no longer over-implementation.
  The helper may keep every branch the existing logic has. This
  applies only when the same logic appears in the current file or in
  a production file read or edited in the recent session. A helper
  whose logic appears nowhere else still needs its own red. Live
  judge on a replica: 0.4.3 allowed 0 of 6, 0.4.4 allowed 8 of 8.
  Three negative controls stayed denied 8 of 8: the same helper with
  no sign of the logic in the session, moved logic plus one new
  branch, and a production write whose test was sent but never run.
- **Parallel dependent edits (#46): documentation only.** Each write
  is judged against the file on disk, before its siblings land, and
  the judge cannot tell a parallel sibling from a finished write.
  Telling it that a session action with no output yet is an in-flight
  sibling was tried and dropped. Where the sibling is visible, 0.4.3
  already allowed the call-site edit (6 of 6), and the instruction let
  a production write through when its test had only been sent and
  never run (6 of 6 allowed; 0.4.3 denied 6 of 6). `hooks/PROBITY.md`
  now says to send dependent edits one after another, and to extract a
  helper in place in the file that holds the logic before calling it
  from elsewhere.

## 0.4.3

The Kotlin TDD judge no longer blocks adding a new red test (#43).

- **Fast path missed tests inserted above another test.** The Kotlin
  fast path passes a write that adds exactly one `@Test` without an AI
  call. It located the inserted text with a greedy common prefix, so a
  test inserted ABOVE an existing test (an Edit anchored on the next
  test's header) shared the `@Test` / `fun` header text, the inserted
  span started mid-header, and the write went to the judge. The fast
  path now considers every equivalent placement of the insertion and
  uses the one holding the new test whole. The file is the same in
  every placement, so the existing safety checks are unchanged.
- **The judge demanded a failing run before a test could exist.** When
  a new test did reach the judge, it could apply "must be observed
  failing first" to the test write itself. The Kotlin judge
  instructions now state that adding a failing test is the red step and
  needs no prior run, whether the behavior is missing or present but
  wrong (including uncommitted production changes); the observed-red
  requirement applies only to the production write that follows.
  Checked against the live judge on a replica of the reported case: the
  0.4.2 instructions denied 3 of 3 runs, the new ones allowed 3 of 3.

## 0.4.2

Fixes for Claude Code sub-agents and git worktrees.

- **Sub-agent work is invisible to Probity (#40).** When a Claude Code
  sub-agent calls a tool, the hook payload carries the parent session's
  `transcript_path` plus an `agent_id`. The sub-agent's own tool calls
  are recorded only in `<session>/subagents/agent-<agent_id>.jsonl`, so
  every history-based rule judged sub-agent work against the parent's
  history. The characterization marker could never be released, and the
  TDD judge never saw a sub-agent's red runs. New bin `probity-claude`
  points `transcript_path` at the sub-agent's transcript, then runs
  Probity unchanged. **Action needed:** change the PreToolUse hook
  command to `cd "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR" && ./node_modules/.bin/probity-claude`.
- **Large test output hid the proof (#40).** Claude Code keeps only a
  2KB preview of a large tool output in the transcript and saves the
  rest under `tool-results/`. The characterization removal check now
  reads that saved output, so a long Gradle run's `FAILED` line counts.
- **Worktrees blocked each other's commits (#39).** The mutation-probe
  and characterization commit gates scanned every file under the root,
  including linked worktrees Claude Code creates at
  `.claude/worktrees/agent-<id>/`. They now skip any directory holding
  a `.git` file (a linked worktree or submodule), and a commit made in
  a worktree nested inside the root is checked against that worktree's
  markers only. The target tree is read from `git -C <dir> commit` or
  `cd <dir> && git commit`, else the hook's working directory.
- Both gates now also trigger on `git -C <dir> commit` and
  `git -c key=value commit`; before, only the literal `git commit`
  was gated.

## 0.4.1

More preset options, so a project with its own conventions can call a
preset instead of copying its rules:

- KMP preset: `seamHint` (the core ambient-effect screen's pointer to
  your clock/randomness port), `conventionHint` (your telemetry
  convention, given to the adapter-observability judge), and
  `acceptanceLanguageGlobs` (which files get the acceptance Language
  Test, e.g. `*Spec.kt` only when driver/DSL files use other names).
- Kotlin preset: `conventionHint`.

Every default is unchanged.

## 0.4.0

Preset options, so projects stop forking rule lists:

- **KMP preset options (#19).** `kmpRuleEntries(root, options)` takes a
  `KmpPresetOptions` object: `specsDir`, `specGlobs`, `glossaryPath`,
  `coreGlobs`, `acceptanceTestGlobs`, `testRoots`, `testFilePattern`,
  `testDeclarationPattern`, `baselinePath`, `driverScopes`,
  `defaultScopes`. Each defaults to the previous hardcoded value, and
  the old `kmpRuleEntries(root, { driverScopes, defaultScopes })` call
  still works.
- **Excluding spikes and build output (#21).** The JS, Kotlin, and KMP
  presets take `excludeGlobs`, default `['spikes/**', '**/build/**']`,
  appended as `!` negations to every files-scoped block. Pass `[]` to
  turn it off. **Behavior change:** writes under `spikes/` or a `build/`
  directory are no longer checked by these presets' rules.
- **JS spec-to-test traceability (#18).** Setting `specsDir` on
  `jsRuleEntries` wires `requireSpecBackedAcceptanceTest`,
  `surfaceScenarioLinkBreakage`, `enforceSpecTestParity`, and (with
  `glossaryPath`) `surfaceGlossaryTermBreakage`, as the KMP preset
  does. Off by default.
- **TypeScript test declarations (#12).** New `JS_TEST_DECLARATION`
  matches vitest/jest/mocha `it(`/`test(` and their `.only`/`.skip`/
  `.each(...)(` variants; the JS preset uses it by default.
- New helper `withExcludeGlobs(entries, globs)` in `rules/scoping.ts`.

`probity-scope-report --allow-empty <glob>` (repeatable) marks a block
as expected to be empty, so a greenfield repository can run `--strict`
in CI from its first commit (#20). A flag that matches no block's glob
is a warning; a flag whose block now has files is noted.

## 0.3.0

Kotlin and KMP presets now wire the characterization round-trip the
Swift preset already had (issue #34). A test that pins behavior
production already has — for example a branch an independent mutation
review found untested — is born green, so no red can precede it, and
the TDD judge could block it with no honest way forward. Now:

- a test-source write (`src/test`, or any `src/<name>Test` source set)
  carrying `// probity: characterization` above the test passes without
  the judge; the marker does nothing in production source;
- the marker comes off only when the session transcript records that
  test failing (typically under a `// probity: mutation-probe`), and the
  new `enforceCharacterizationResolution` commit gate blocks `git commit`
  while any marker is on disk;
- `withCharacterizationTest` (all presets that use it) appends a note
  naming the marker when it denies an unmarked test-layer write for
  lacking a red, and resolves backticked Kotlin test names
  (``fun `rejects blank ids`()``) in full for the removal proof.

**Behavior change:** Kotlin/KMP commits are now blocked while a
`probity: characterization` marker is on disk. No existing project
carries the marker unless it opted in.

The TDD judge in every preset reports a judge that returned no verdict
as an infrastructure failure (issue #32). A spend-limit, quota, or auth
notice used to surface as `could not parse verdict from validator
output: …`, which reads as a rejection of the change. The write is
still blocked (fail closed), but the deny text now says it was not
judged, whether the provider reported itself unavailable, and which
writes still pass deterministically. The wrapper is exported as
`withJudgeFailureDiagnostics` from `rules/gates.ts`.

`probity-scope-report` no longer flags test files under a core-purity
rule as "adapter/DI/UI-looking" (issue #26). A test-wide
`forbidContentPattern` (such as a no-mocking-library screen over every
test source set) legitimately covers adapter tests; the old warning
suggested excluding them, which would weaken the check. Production
adapter paths are still flagged.

## 0.2.3

`enforceSpecTestParity` now inspects the pending Git commit before scanning
specifications and acceptance tests. It runs only when that commit records the
specs path (including a git-submodule pointer) or a path matching the configured
acceptance-test pattern; Git inspection failures retain full enforcement.

This restores the documented specs-first order for projects whose specs live in
a separate repository: committing an `@wip` removal inside the specs checkout,
or committing unrelated parent-repository work while that checkout is dirty, no
longer scans an uncommitted submodule worktree that cannot yet contain its
covering SDK test. The later parent commit that records the new specs pointer or
acceptance test still enforces bidirectional parity. No config change is needed.

## 0.2.2

Kotlin and KMP presets now retain up to 20 recent session events, each
clipped at 6,000 characters, for the AI TDD judge. This keeps a nearby
targeted red visible after normal source inspection while bounding prompt
growth. Their Kotlin-specific guidance also makes explicit that:

- as an exception to generic placeholder guidance, a targeted relevant test
  executing `TODO()`/`kotlin.NotImplementedError` is clean red without a
  second assertion-failure run, while implementation remains bounded by
  assertions in that test source visible in recent history;
- compile/import/signature failures authorize scaffolding only, not the
  asserted production behavior;
- one observed failure may drive one cohesive write across every method or
  branch those visible assertions require, without artificial reruns
  mid-write; and
- Git staging/index state is irrelevant to the judgment.

JavaScript and Swift presets retain their existing instructions and history
windows.

## 0.2.1

`requireGreenTestRun`'s Kotlin/Gradle defaults are stricter and cover more
real Gradle usage:

- Accepts `build`/`check` (run tests without the word "test"),
  module-qualified tasks, `allTests`, `jvmTest` — but rejects `--dry-run`,
  `-x`/`--exclude-task`, flag values that read like a task (`--args=build`),
  and lookalike tasks that don't run one (`assembleAndroidTest`, ...).
- Recognizes verification invocations inside compound/piped strings while using
  a structured command check to reject `./gradlew test; echo gradlew` as proof
  from exit status alone.
- Under Kiro, a quiet run with no `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` banner is accepted via
  the tool result's structured `exit_status`, only when that Gradle
  invocation is provably last; piped/chained/`|| true` runs still need the
  banner. A malformed envelope or non-zero `exit_status` is always red.
- Failure detection also recognizes `FAILURE:` and `Execution failed for
  task`.
- `gates.ts`'s `requireGreenTestRun` gained additive, optional hooks:
  `commandPredicate`, `extraSuccessPredicate`, `extraFailurePredicate`.
  Unused by default; no behavior change for existing callers.
- Fixed an isolation defect: the Swift preset no longer inherits
  Gradle-flavored deny text or the Kiro shortcut — both apply only when
  `command` is referentially `GRADLE_TEST_COMMAND`.
- `options.reason`, when set, now appends on both deny paths (previously
  only "no run recorded" did).

## 0.2.0

Kotlin presets now receive the ast-grep Kotlin parser automatically through
exact-version optional dependencies. A normal `@jjchill/probity-rules`
install can therefore recognize a single new red `@Test` deterministically
instead of silently sending it to the AI TDD judge.

The Kotlin fast path is also conservative: only a Kotlin test-source write
that adds one runnable, structurally annotated test and preserves every prior
source byte and test function bypasses the judge. Existing files may make one
contiguous insertion containing only the test (plus comments/whitespace) or a
separate test class with no additional functions; brand-new files may include
imports and property fixtures. Test deletion, disabling or weakening, new disable controls, changes
to existing test-container headers, declarations that shadow identifiers used
by existing tests, and multi-test additions continue to delegate. Production-source paths now always delegate, closing a
latent bypass that becomes material when parser support is installed by
default. If parser support or current-file content is unavailable, the
delegated result carries an explicit fast-path-unavailable diagnostic. As
with Probity's built-in fast paths, a deterministic pass skips the AI judge's
refactor-readiness check for that write.

The optional parser packages include platform-specific native artifacts and
the Kotlin grammar's install script. npm tolerates an unsupported optional
install and the rule falls back as above; consumers that do not use Kotlin or
need to avoid optional install work can use `npm install --omit=optional`.

## 0.1.0

First packaged release. Previously, consumers `cp`'d `probity.config.ts` +
`rules/` + `scripts/` into their project; rule fixes in this fork never
reached them. Rules and scripts are now a versioned npm package
(`@jjchill/probity-rules`); the config stays project-owned and imports
preset factories from the package.

Migrating from the copied-templates layout:

- `./rules/<x>.js` imports → `@jjchill/probity-rules/rules/<x>`
- `npx tsx scripts/scope-report.ts` → `npx probity-scope-report`
- `node scripts/spec-parity.mjs` → `npx probity-spec-parity`

Or run `/probity-update`, which detects the legacy layout and offers to
migrate it for you.
