/**
 * Replica of Probity's glob-scoping internals, for the tooling in
 * this template set — the workflow eval and `scripts/scope-report.ts`
 * — which must resolve `{ files, rules }` blocks exactly the way the
 * real engine does. Hand-mirrored scoping predicates were the eval's
 * main blind spot: a template glob edit could silently diverge from
 * what the eval exercised.
 *
 * Probity implements these in `src/rules/utils/match-paths.ts`
 * (`buildMatcher`, `actionMatchesFilesScope`) and `src/config.ts`
 * (`anchorGlob` inside `loadConfig`), but its package `exports` map
 * (".", "./types", "./rules") does not expose them, so they are
 * ported here verbatim — same picomatch options, same anchoring
 * convention. Pinned against @nizos/probity 1.10.0: on a Probity
 * upgrade, diff this file against those two sources; if upstream
 * starts exporting them, delete this file and import instead.
 *
 * picomatch is Probity's own matcher dependency, so the same version
 * resolves here in any project with @nizos/probity installed; if your
 * package manager doesn't hoist it, add it: `npm install -D picomatch`.
