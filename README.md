# Agent Skills

**Production-grade engineering skills for AI coding agents.**

Skills encode the workflows, quality gates, and best practices that senior engineers use when building software. These ones are packaged so AI agents follow them consistently across every phase of development.

This distribution pairs the skills with **[Probity](https://github.com/nizos/probity)**, a PreToolUse rule engine that mechanically enforces the disciplines the skills teach: a failing test before production code, ports-and-adapters boundaries, spec-first acceptance tests, and a green test run before every commit. **A complete install has two parts: the skills, and a Probity guardrail installed and configured in the target project.** Installing only the skills leaves every gate switched off. See [Quick Start](#quick-start).

## Commands

9 slash commands that map to the development lifecycle. Each one activates the right skills automatically.

| What you're doing | Command | Key principle |
|-------------------|---------|---------------|
| Define what to build | `/spec` | Spec before code |
| Plan how to build it | `/plan` | Small, atomic tasks |
| Build incrementally | `/build` | One slice at a time |
| Prove it works | `/test` | Tests are proof |
| Review before merge | `/review` | Improve code health |
| Audit web performance | `/webperf` | Measure before you optimize |
| Simplify the code | `/code-simplify` | Clarity over cleverness |
| Ship to production | `/ship` | Faster is safer |
| Keep enforcement current | `/probity-update` | Updates flow, forks rot |

Want fewer manual steps once the spec exists? **`/build auto`** generates the plan and implements every task in a single approved pass — you approve the plan once, then it runs autonomously. It removes the human stepping *between* tasks, not the verification: every task is still test-driven and committed individually, and it pauses on failures or risky steps.

Skills also activate automatically based on what you're doing — designing an API triggers `api-and-interface-design`, building UI triggers `frontend-ui-engineering`, and so on.

## Quick Start

> **Installing with an AI agent?** The install is **not finished** once the skills are copied. Part 2 below (Probity) is a required step, not an optional extra: Probity must be installed *in the target project*, its config edited to that project's layout, its scoping verified, and its hook wired into the agent. Work through the [install checklist](#install-checklist) before reporting done.

Setup has two parts. Do both.

| Part | What it installs | Where it lives |
|------|------------------|----------------|
| **1. Skills** | The workflow skills, agent personas, and slash commands the agent *reads* | Your agent's skill or plugin directory |
| **2. Probity** | The rule engine that *blocks* tool calls violating those workflows, plus this repo's rule templates | The target project's root (`probity.config.ts`, `rules/`, `scripts/`) and its agent hook config |

### Part 1: Install the skills

The commands below install from this fork, [JJChill/agent-skills](https://github.com/JJChill/agent-skills). It carries the full upstream [addyosmani/agent-skills](https://github.com/addyosmani/agent-skills) catalog plus the Probity templates that Part 2 depends on; installing from upstream gives you the skills but not `hooks/probity/`.

**Fastest path — any agent, one command.** The open [skills CLI](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) installs into 70+ agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Copilot, Cline, and more):

```bash
npx skills add JJChill/agent-skills            # install all 31 skills
npx skills add JJChill/agent-skills --list     # browse before installing
```

Or grab individual skills:

```bash
npx skills add JJChill/agent-skills --skill code-review-and-quality   # five-axis review before merge
npx skills add JJChill/agent-skills --skill interview-me              # requirements interrogation, one question at a time
npx skills add JJChill/agent-skills --skill test-driven-development   # red-green-refactor, enforced
```

> **Installing one skill?** A per-skill `npx` install copies only
> `skills/<name>/`, not the repo-level `references/` directory. The skill still
> works, but paths to supplementary shared checklists are unavailable. Use a
> whole-repo integration, clone the repository, or copy the needed checklist into
> a `references/` directory inside the installed skill. This portability gap is
> tracked in [#361](https://github.com/addyosmani/agent-skills/issues/361).

Prefer a native integration? Pick your tool below.

<details>
<summary><b>Claude Code (recommended)</b></summary>

**Marketplace install:**

```
/plugin marketplace add JJChill/agent-skills
/plugin install agent-skills@jjchill-agent-skills
```

> **SSH errors?** The marketplace clones repos via SSH. If you don't have SSH keys set up on GitHub, either [add your SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) or use the full HTTPS URL to force HTTPS cloning during the marketplace-add step:
> ```bash
> /plugin marketplace add https://github.com/JJChill/agent-skills.git
> /plugin install agent-skills@jjchill-agent-skills
> ```
>
> If `/plugin install` still fails with `git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey)` on Windows or macOS, the recommended workaround is to configure Git once to rewrite GitHub SSH URLs to HTTPS for subprocess clones:
> ```bash
> git config --global url."https://github.com/".insteadOf git@github.com:
> ```

**Local / development:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JJChill/agent-skills.git
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/agent-skills
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Cursor</b></summary>

Put workflow skills under `.cursor/skills/` (sync from `agent-skills/skills/`) and short policies in `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` — do not paste full skills into rules. See [docs/cursor-setup.md](docs/cursor-setup.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Antigravity CLI</b></summary>

Install as a native plugin for skills and subagents. In affected Antigravity CLI releases, legacy command TOMLs are reported as converted but their wrapper commands are not discoverable; invoke the underlying namespaced skills directly. See [docs/antigravity-setup.md](docs/antigravity-setup.md#lifecycle-workflows-and-command-compatibility).

**Install from the repo:**

```bash
agy plugin install https://github.com/JJChill/agent-skills.git
```

**Install from a local clone:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JJChill/agent-skills.git
agy plugin install ./agent-skills
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Gemini CLI</b></summary>

Install as native skills for auto-discovery, or add to `GEMINI.md` for persistent context. See [docs/gemini-cli-setup.md](docs/gemini-cli-setup.md).

**Install from the repo:**

```bash
gemini skills install https://github.com/JJChill/agent-skills.git --path skills
```

**Install from a local clone:**

```bash
gemini skills install ./agent-skills/skills/
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Windsurf</b></summary>

Add skill contents to your Windsurf rules configuration. See [docs/windsurf-setup.md](docs/windsurf-setup.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>OpenCode</b></summary>

Copy skills to `.opencode/skills/` (or `~/.config/opencode/skills/`), add a project-local `AGENTS.md`, and use the built-in `skill` tool for agent-driven execution. Optional slash commands can be added under `.opencode/commands/`.

See [docs/opencode-setup.md](docs/opencode-setup.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>GitHub Copilot</b></summary>

Use agent definitions from `agents/` as Copilot personas and skill content in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. See [docs/copilot-setup.md](docs/copilot-setup.md).

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Kiro IDE & CLI </b></summary>

Skills for Kiro reside under `.kiro/skills/` (project or global level), and Kiro also reads `AGENTS.md`. See the Kiro docs at https://kiro.dev/docs/skills/.

Kiro users still complete [Part 2 of the Quick Start](#part-2-install-and-configure-probity-in-the-target-project) (Probity installed and configured in the project); only the hook wiring differs. Probity has no native Kiro vendor, so a thin preToolUse shim translates Kiro's tool events to Probity's `claude-code` contract and back, letting one `probity.config.ts` enforce both agents. Assets live in [`hooks/probity/kiro/`](hooks/probity/kiro/); see [docs/kiro-setup.md](docs/kiro-setup.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Codex</b></summary>

Install as a native Codex plugin (Codex CLI v0.122+):

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add JJChill/agent-skills
codex plugin add agent-skills@agent-skills
```

The first command registers the marketplace; the second installs the plugin. Codex reads the root `skills/` directory directly through `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`. Once installed, invoke skills in chat using `@` (e.g., `@spec-driven-development`). See [docs/codex-setup.md](docs/codex-setup.md) for local installation and troubleshooting.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Command Code</b></summary>

Install natively with the built-in `cmd skills` command. Command Code clones the repo, discovers every `SKILL.md`, and installs into `.commandcode/skills/`:

```bash
cmd skills add JJChill/agent-skills            # pick skills to install (project)
cmd skills add JJChill/agent-skills --global   # install for all projects (~/.commandcode/skills/)
cmd skills add JJChill/agent-skills -s spec-driven-development  # install a specific skill
```

Installed skills show up in the TUI slash menu, e.g. `/spec-driven-development`. See [docs/commandcode-setup.md](docs/commandcode-setup.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Other Agents</b></summary>

Skills are plain Markdown - they work with any agent that accepts system prompts or instruction files. See [docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md).

</details>



### Part 2: Install and configure Probity in the target project

Probity lives in the **project you are building**, not in this repo. The skills tell the agent what good looks like; Probity intercepts every `Write`/`Edit`/`Bash` call before it executes and blocks the ones that break the rules, with a corrective message the agent recovers from. Without it, the skills are advice the agent can rationalize away under pressure. [hooks/PROBITY.md](hooks/PROBITY.md) is the full reference (every rule, what it enforces, and how); the steps below are the minimum viable setup.

**Agent support.** Probity hooks into Claude Code, Codex, and GitHub Copilot CLI natively, and into Kiro through the shim in [`hooks/probity/kiro/`](hooks/probity/kiro/) ([docs/kiro-setup.md](docs/kiro-setup.md)). Other agents (Cursor, Gemini CLI, Windsurf, and so on) have no hook Probity can attach to, so they get the skills only. Record that in the project's agent instructions so nobody assumes the gates are live.

Run everything below from the target project's root.

**1. Install Probity and the rule package.** Node is required even for non-Node projects; a one-dependency `package.json` next to `gradlew` or the `.xcworkspace` is fine (Swift projects: give it `"type": "module"`).

```bash
npm install -D @nizos/probity @jjchill/probity-rules
```


Kotlin parser support for the deterministic single-test TDD fast path ships
with the rule package and installs automatically as optional dependencies. If
a platform cannot install the parser, or disk/install constraints require
`npm install --omit=optional`, Kotlin writes delegate to the AI TDD rule with
an explicit fast-path-unavailable diagnostic.

**2. Pick the preset for the project's language** and copy in its thin config template — a short file that imports the preset's rule factory from the package and calls it with this project's options.

| Project | Preset factory / template | Calibrated for |
|---------|----------------------------|-----------------|
| JavaScript / TypeScript | `jsRuleEntries` · [`probity.config.ts`](hooks/probity/probity.config.ts) | `src/core` + `src/adapters` layout, vitest or jest |
| Kotlin / JVM / Android | `kotlinRuleEntries` · [`probity.config.kotlin.ts`](hooks/probity/probity.config.kotlin.ts) | Multi-module Gradle, `*-core` / `*-ui` split, a mocking library present |
| Kotlin Multiplatform | `kmpRuleEntries` · [`probity.config.kmp.ts`](hooks/probity/probity.config.kmp.ts) | Per-feature hexagonal packages, fakes only, Markdown specs in `docs/specs/` |
| Swift / iOS | `swiftRuleEntries` · [`probity.config.swift.ts`](hooks/probity/probity.config.swift.ts) | Xcode workspace, `AcceptanceTests/` four-layer suite, XCUITest |

```bash
cp node_modules/@jjchill/probity-rules/probity.config.ts ./probity.config.ts   # or probity.config.kotlin.ts / .kmp.ts / .swift.ts
```

Keep `probity.config.ts` at the project root: Probity discovers it by searching upward from the working directory. The rule modules and scripts the template imports live inside the installed package — nothing else needs copying.

If the project will use the glossary or spec-parity rules, seed the files they read: copy `node_modules/@jjchill/probity-rules/GLOSSARY.template.md` to `docs/GLOSSARY.md`, and create `docs/specs/` for feature files. Both degrade gracefully while absent, but the Kotlin Multiplatform and Swift presets are built around them.

**3. Edit the config for this project.** The thin template calls the preset's rule factory (`jsRuleEntries`, `kotlinRuleEntries`, `kmpRuleEntries`, or `swiftRuleEntries`) with an options object — that options object, not the package internals, is what you edit. The presets describe a *typical* layout and **will not match yours as-is**. Open `probity.config.ts` and set its factory options to change, at minimum:

- **Core-purity globs.** Point them at the project's domain, use-case, and port code only. Adapters, DI modules, composition roots, and UI must *not* match, or the boundary rule blocks work those files are supposed to do.
- **TDD scope globs.** The production and test code you want red-green-refactor enforced on. This rule costs a model call per matching write, so scope it deliberately.
- **Spec-layer globs.** The acceptance specification files only, never the DSL or protocol-driver layers (those legitimately contain the mechanics the Language Test blocks).
- **Commit gate.** The `command`, `successPattern`, and `failurePattern` passed to `requireGreenTestRun` must match the project's real test command and its runner's summary lines. The JS/TS default covers vitest and jest, Kotlin defaults to Gradle, Swift to `xcodebuild`.
- **Infrastructure import screen.** Extend the known-vendor regex with the project's actual frameworks, SDKs, and I/O libraries.
- **Preset-specific paths.** Kotlin and Swift presets: `specsDir`, `testFilePattern`, module and package names. Optional `glossaryPath` and `seamHint` once a glossary and canonical ports exist.

Brownfield codebase? The deterministic rules are delta-based (only what a write *introduces* blocks; existing call sites do not), and a spec suite that predates the parity gate gets a one-time baseline so existing gaps do not block every commit:

```bash
npx probity-spec-parity --specs docs/specs --baseline docs/specs/.parity-baseline --write-baseline
```

See "Brownfield adoption" in [hooks/PROBITY.md](hooks/PROBITY.md#spectest-traceability-kmp-preset).

**4. Verify the scoping before the first agent session does.** Wrong globs are the main failure mode, and one direction is silent: a glob slightly too narrow never fires, and nothing notices.

```bash
npx probity-scope-report --config probity.config.ts
```

Fix every `DEAD SCOPE` (a block matching zero files) and every warning about core rules claiming adapter/DI/UI paths or the acceptance-language rule claiming driver/DSL files. Re-run until it is clean. Add `--strict` in CI so layout drift fails the build instead of silently switching a rule off.

**5. Wire the hook into the agent.** For Claude Code, install the Probity plugin:

```
/plugin marketplace add nizos/probity
/plugin install probity@probity
```

Or add it to the project's `.claude/settings.json` so every teammate and every future session inherits it:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash|Write|Edit|NotebookEdit",
        "hooks": [
          { "type": "command", "command": "cd \"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\" && ./node_modules/.bin/probity --agent claude-code" }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Keep the `cd "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR" &&` anchor. Hooks are not guaranteed to run from the repo root; a bare relative path then fails **non-blocking** and every rule silently stops enforcing. Codex and Copilot CLI wiring is in [Probity's setup guide](https://github.com/nizos/probity/blob/main/docs/setup.md) (`--agent codex` / `--agent github-copilot`); Kiro is in [docs/kiro-setup.md](docs/kiro-setup.md).

AI-validated rules reuse the agent's own authentication through the vendor SDK. No extra API key or billing is needed.

**6. Prove a gate fires.** Start a fresh agent session in the project and ask it to add a small production function under a core path with no test. The write must be blocked with a Probity message naming the TDD rule. Then ask it to `git commit` without running the tests; the commit must be blocked by the green-run gate. If either action goes through, the hook is not wired or the globs do not claim that path. Go back to step 4.

**7. Commit the setup.** `package.json`, the lockfile, `probity.config.ts`, the hook settings, and any glossary or baseline files belong in the target repo. Enforcement that lives on one machine is not enforcement.

**Updating.** Once this is set up, keep it current with `/probity-update` instead of re-running these steps by hand. It upgrades the `@jjchill/probity-rules` package, proposes config migrations for anything the new version wires that your `probity.config.ts` doesn't yet, refreshes the Kiro shim files if the project uses Kiro, and re-verifies scoping.

### Install checklist

An install of this pack is complete when all of the following are true in the target project. Agents performing the install: report each item explicitly, and do not describe Probity as optional.

- [ ] Skills installed for the agent in use (Part 1)
- [ ] `@nizos/probity` installed as a dev dependency in the target project
- [ ] `@jjchill/probity-rules` installed and `probity.config.ts` created from the matching preset template
- [ ] Every glob, the commit-gate test command, and the vendor import screen edited to this project's real layout
- [ ] `npx probity-scope-report` runs clean (no dead scopes, no mis-claimed layers)
- [ ] PreToolUse hook wired for the agent (plugin or settings file), anchored to the project directory
- [ ] A deliberate violation was blocked in a live session (step 6)
- [ ] Config, package.json, lockfile, and hook settings committed to the repo
- [ ] If the agent in use is one Probity cannot hook (Cursor, Gemini CLI, Windsurf, ...), that limitation is written into the project's agent instructions

---

## Adoption

Skills and Probity both installed? How you roll the pack out depends on your codebase. The **[Adoption Guide](docs/adoption-guide.md)** covers two paths: the full lifecycle from day one for a greenfield project, or an incremental, verification-first rollout for an established codebase.

---

## All 32 Skills

The commands above are entry points. The pack includes 32 skills total — 31 lifecycle skills plus the `using-agent-skills` meta-skill. Each skill is a structured workflow with steps, verification gates, and anti-rationalization tables. You can also reference any skill directly.

### Meta - Discover which skill applies

## Agent Personas

Pre-configured specialist personas for targeted reviews:

| Agent | Role | Perspective |
|-------|------|-------------|

## How Skills Work

Every skill follows a consistent anatomy:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

│  Overview         → What this skill does        │
│  When to Use      → Triggering conditions       │
│  Process          → Step-by-step workflow       │
│  Rationalizations → Excuses + rebuttals         │
│  Red Flags        → Signs something's wrong     │
│  Verification     → Evidence requirements       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key design choices:**

- **Process, not prose.** Skills are workflows agents follow, not reference docs they read. Each has steps, checkpoints, and exit criteria.
- **Anti-rationalization.** Every skill includes a table of common excuses agents use to skip steps (e.g., "I'll add tests later") with documented counter-arguments.
- **Verification is non-negotiable.** Every skill ends with evidence requirements - tests passing, build output, runtime data. "Seems right" is never sufficient.
- **Progressive disclosure.** The `SKILL.md` is the entry point. Supporting references load only when needed, keeping token usage minimal.

## Why Agent Skills?

AI coding agents default to the shortest path - which often means skipping specs, tests, security reviews, and the practices that make software reliable. Agent Skills gives agents structured workflows that enforce the same discipline senior engineers bring to production code.

Each skill encodes hard-won engineering judgment: *when* to write a spec, *what* to test, *how* to review, and *when* to ship. These aren't generic prompts - they're the kind of opinionated, process-driven workflows that separate production-quality work from prototype-quality work.

Skills bake in best practices from Google's engineering culture — including concepts from [Software Engineering at Google](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book) and Google's [engineering practices guide](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/). You'll find Hyrum's Law in API design, the Beyonce Rule and test pyramid in testing, change sizing and review speed norms in code review, Chesterton's Fence in simplification, trunk-based development in git workflow, Shift Left and feature flags in CI/CD, and a dedicated deprecation skill treating code as a liability. These aren't abstract principles — they're embedded directly into the step-by-step workflows agents follow.

## How it compares

Wondering how this stacks up against [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) or [Matt Pocock's skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills)? See **[docs/comparison.md](docs/comparison.md)** for an honest, side-by-side look at how the three are shaped differently and when to reach for each — including a link to a controlled [head-to-head experiment](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/superpowers-vs-agent-skills-faster-shipping-safer-reasoning-om-mishra-dzakf/).

## Contributing

Skills should be **specific** (actionable steps, not vague advice), **verifiable** (clear exit criteria with evidence requirements), **battle-tested** (based on real workflows), and **minimal** (only what's needed to guide the agent).

See [docs/skill-anatomy.md](docs/skill-anatomy.md) for the format specification and [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.
